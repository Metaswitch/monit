For some slow-to-start processes monit can, especially at bootup,
start to monitor a process before it is fully initialised.  This can
cause monit to erroneously attempt a restart.

To avoid this, you should set the "start delay" option in monitrc.  A
typical example looks like this:

 --8<--
  set daemon 120
    with start delay 240
 --8<--
