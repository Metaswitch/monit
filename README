MONIT - UNIX Systems Management


Introduction
------------

Monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs,
files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts automatic
maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error
situations.

Monit logs to syslog or to its own log file and notifies you about error
conditions via customizable alert messages. Monit can perform various
TCP/IP network checks, protocol checks and can utilize SSL for such checks.
Monit provides an optional http(s) interface and you can use a browser to
access the Monit program.
